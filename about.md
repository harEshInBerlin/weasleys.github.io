In 2017 I graduated from uni, got the best job straight outta uni, threw that away for a chance to live abroad and am now living it up in London.
Facing an existential crisis(:sos:) now that my goals for a long time were achieved, I start this blog with the optimism for 2018.
The hope is that every week I'd write a blog post about my week that was. :)
