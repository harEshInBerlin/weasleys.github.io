title: What a hectic week!
---
Hola!

I went to Spanish for week 2 :)

I went swing dancing on Monday, which was insane fun. XD
I went swing dancing on Sunday as well, we learnt the rock step, change places, turn and two basic steps. The class was smaller and there was an insanely hot guy in the class who I got to dance with. :P

I finished reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and will go the bookclub meeting this Thursday. More on that later.
Also started reading Shrill, loving it so far.

I walked > 12,500 steps everyday this week. Well except for today, but that's okay.

Went to Manjal on Friday, great food!

I started reading the paper, but did not get the time to summarize. :(

I did not run a single day this week, which is very disappointing to say the least. But I start gym from Monday, so that should fix that.

Updated resume, will send it to Twitter folks this week.
