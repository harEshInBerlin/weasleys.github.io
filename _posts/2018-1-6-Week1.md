title: First week!

This week started on Tuesday, with this gorgeous sunrise view!

I went running on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

I went bouldering on Thursday.

I finished reading Seven Brief Lessons on Physics by Carlo Rovelli. It is an interesting read with very high level description of the major breakthroughs  in physics in last two centuries. It is admirable that Carlo was able to "dumb down" such complex subject matter that someone who is a STEM major but not in physics can understand it.

I did read through the Introduction chapter of Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio. I'm hoping to learn the math in the book as well to be able to better read understand the papers and deep learning content I read eventually. I'll be reading this book cover to cover.

I visited the Harry Potter history of magic exhibhition at the British library!!!
