title: Hola from Barcelona!
---

This week was spent in anxiety over an email. Flatmates can attest to that.

I have an assignment to do, but that is okay.

Barcelona is so freaking cool! I actually would have loved to travel Barcelona with Tanya, it is exactly her kind of city. I don't know when, but really want to do a Europe backpacking trip with her :)

I did a Gaudi tour today and I''m absolutely tired. I walked 20 kms, so I'm getting up early tomorrow, seeing the sunrise from the beach?(ambitious I know)

I will do a party crawl tomorrow!!
