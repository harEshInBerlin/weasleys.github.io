Hola!

I started learning Spanish! Entiendes, no entiendes? :P

I also went swing dancing, which was insane fun. XD

I am almost finished reading Fear and Hunting in Las Vegas.

I went to Dishoom today, finally! The food was good, but not amazing. Also went to Columbia flower market, got a plant. :)

Also, got a fitbit to track my activity and get more active.

We had an 11 course meal on Friday, went to a house party after, which was a lot of fun.

Work was insanely busy, I am running behind on my paper blogs that I publish to medium.

Also, I have to return Homo Deus, so I have to remoce it from my list. I think I'll add Flowers for Algernon instead.

Running is going well, kind of. I have no time to run on Mondays and Tuesdays. I think I will start going for a run on the days I go climbing.

Too lazt to add photos today. Might do later :)

On agenda -
Update resume.
Read two papers.
