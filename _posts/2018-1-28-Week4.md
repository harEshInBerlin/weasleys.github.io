title: Last week of January!!
---

I saw Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missourie. It's kind of a slice of life story where nothing gets resolved, but yeah that is life.


On Friday, Gant and I went to Buds & Siri ka ghar, where after they got drunk they talked till 6 in the morning :P

On Sunday, I chilled and studied.

That is all!
Also, writing it a week later so don't remember much. Yep also was running a fever for the better part of the week.
